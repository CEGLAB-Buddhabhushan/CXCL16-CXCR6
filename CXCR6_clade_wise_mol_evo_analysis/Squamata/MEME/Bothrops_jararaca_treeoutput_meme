Analysis Description
--------------------
MEME (Mixed Effects Model of Evolution) estimates a site-wise synonymous
(&alpha;) and a two-category mixture of non-synonymous (&beta;-, with
proportion p-, and &beta;+ with proportion [1-p-]) rates, and uses a
likelihood ratio test to determine if &beta;+ > &alpha; at a site. The
estimates aggregate information over a proportion of branches at a site,
so the signal is derived from episodic diversification, which is a
combination of strength of selection [effect size] and the proportion of
the tree affected. A subset of branches can be selected for testing as
well, in which case an additional (nuisance) parameter will be inferred
-- the non-synonymous rate on branches NOT selected for testing.
Multiple partitions within a NEXUS file are also supported for
recombination - aware analysis. Version 3.0 adds a different format for
ancestral state reconstruction, branch-site posterior storage, and
site-level heterogeneity testing.

>[WARNING] This dataset contains 1 duplicate sequence. Identical
sequences do not contribute any information to the analysis and only
slow down computation. Please consider removing duplicate or 'nearly'
duplicate sequences, e.g. using

>Select the p-value threshold to use when testing for selection (permissible range = [0,1], default value = 0.1): 
>pvalue –> 0.1

>[Advanced setting, will result in MUCH SLOWER run time] Perform parametric bootstrap resampling to derive site-level null LRT distributions up to this many replicates per site. Recommended use for small to medium (<30 sequences) datasets (permissible range = [0,1000], default value = 50, integer):
